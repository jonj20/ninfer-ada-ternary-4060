 * Op: rmsnorm_swiglu_mlp
 *
 * Math / indexing, for the BF16 residual [D,T] and M = gate_up_rows / 2:
 *   n[:,t]     = rmsnorm(residual, norm)[:,t]            (RmsNormPrologue, rmsnorm() semantics)

 *   a[i,t]     = SiLU(g[i,t]) * u[i,t]
 *   ideal[:,t] = residual[:,t] + Linear(a, down)[:,t].
 *
 * Registered domain (rmsnorm_swiglu_mlp_accepts()), both policies AllowA8/AllowA4, T any
 * positive value, the residual contiguous 16-byte aligned BF16 [D,T], the norm weight contiguous
 * BF16 [D]:
 *   - T5_G128_FP16 TernaryRowK128 gate_up [2M,D] (gate rows [0,M) before up rows [M,2M)) and
 *     down [D,M], D and M multiples of 1024 (Bonsai: D = 5120, M = 17408). A weight carrying
 *     input signs is stored in the Prism-rotated basis and rotates its input itself.
 *   - Q4_G64_FP16 RowSplit gate_up [34816,5120] (folded as linear_swiglu()) and Q5_G64_FP16
 *     RowSplit down [5120,17408] (Qwen3.8).
 *
 * Numeric:
 *   The oracle evaluates n, g, u, a and ideal naively in FP64 from the represented residual,
 *   norm weight and decoded weights, and the updated BF16 residual is compared with ideal under
 *   the A8 criterion (activation quantization plus BF16 storage).
 *   - T5: n and a are private arithmetic, not semantic rounding boundaries: each is evaluated
 *     inside the int8 quantization of the following projection and never rounded to BF16. g and
 *     u are staged in BF16.
 *   - Q4/Q5: the block equals rmsnorm(), linear_swiglu() and linear_add() composed, bit for bit:
 *     n and a are rounded to BF16 as those Ops store them, and each projection takes its
 *     documented A8 quantization of that BF16 input from the width at which it does so (129
 *     columns), otherwise its A16 route. At those widths n and a are quantized where they are
 *     produced (RMSNorm row kernel, gate/up epilogue) and never stored in BF16.
 *
 * Effects:
 *   Updates the full residual in place; the weights, the norm weight and the workspace must not
 *   overlap it.
 *
 * Workspace:
 *   Caller-owned transient storage reported by rmsnorm_swiglu_mlp_workspace_capacity_bytes(),
 *   scoped to the call: g and u (T5) or n and a (Q4/Q5, BF16 or quantized), and the quantized
 *   activation of each projection. There is no persistent state side effect.
